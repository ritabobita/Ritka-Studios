            <p className="text-left w-[30rem]">Hi! I'm Rita, the artist behind Ritka Studios. 
              My journey with ceramics began in 2021, but my creative path spans many forms of artistic expressionâ€”from music to photography and video production. 
              What draws me to ceramics is the intuitive connection between hands and clay.
              <br />
              <br />
              My approach to pottery is deeply influenced by my background in other art forms, where I learned that there's always a way to translate an idea into reality. 
              That philosophy leads me to make use of and embrace experimentation.
              I work both on the wheel and with hand-building techniques, creating pieces with a simple intention: to make objects that are fun to look at or fun to use. 
              Each piece is handcrafted with care, often featuring dynamic color combinations that work together to create a harmonious whole.
              <br />
