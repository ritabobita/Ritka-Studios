# Ritka Studios - Claude Development Guide

## Project Overview
Ritka Studios is a pottery website built with Next.js, featuring a dynamic events gallery system and static work showcase. The site automatically manages event visibility based on real-time scheduling.

## Key Features Implemented

### üéØ Dynamic Events Gallery
The crown jewel of the project - an intelligent events system that automatically manages event visibility.

**Location:** `src/app/components/Events Gallery/`

**Key Features:**
- **Smart Time-Based Filtering**: Events automatically disappear after their end time passes
- **Timezone Support**: Proper EST/EDT handling using date-fns-tz library
- **Sliding Gallery**: Smooth horizontal scrolling with navigation buttons
- **Real Event Data**: Displays actual event flyers and links to external event pages
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across all device sizes

**Technical Implementation:**
- Uses `date-fns-tz` for reliable timezone conversion
- Events expire exactly 1 minute after their end time
- Automatic navigation button visibility based on content overflow
- Optimized with `useMemo` for performance

### üìù Events Data Management
**File:** `src/app/components/Events Gallery/eventsData.js`

Events are stored in a clean, maintainable format:
```javascript
{
  id: 1,
  title: 'Event Name',
  date: '2025-09-13',
  startTime: '12:00',
  endTime: '17:00',
  timezone: 'America/New_York',
  location: 'Event Location',
  img: '/images/event-flyer.jpg',
  url: 'https://event-website.com'
}
```

**To Add New Events:**
1. Open `eventsData.js`
2. Add event object to the array
3. Place flyer image in `public/images/`
4. Event will automatically appear and disappear based on timing

### üñºÔ∏è Static Work Gallery
**Location:** `src/app/components/Static Work Gallery/`

Features a 2x2 grid layout showcasing pottery work with:
- Hover animations
- Direct link to Etsy shop
- Responsive design for all devices
- Clean decorative line elements

## Core Technical Decisions

### ‚è∞ Event Timing Logic
**Critical Feature:** Events automatically expire based on real-time comparison

**How it works:**
1. `isEventActive()` function compares current time to event end time
2. Uses `zonedTimeToUtc()` for accurate timezone conversion
3. Events disappear exactly when their end time passes (plus 1 minute grace period)
4. Filtering happens on component render - no manual refresh needed

**Code Location:** `src/app/components/Events Gallery/EventsGallery.js:10-19`

### üé® Styling Architecture
- **SCSS Modules**: Component-scoped styling
- **Nested selectors**: Clean, maintainable CSS structure  
- **Mobile-first approach**: Responsive breakpoints at 768px and 480px
- **Consistent naming**: BEM-style class naming convention

### üöÄ Performance Optimizations
1. **Data Extraction**: Events data moved to separate file
2. **Memoization**: `useMemo` for event filtering
3. **Function Hoisting**: Utility functions moved outside components
4. **Consolidated Logic**: Combined slide functions and state management

## Important Commands

### Development
```bash
npm run dev        # Start development server
npm run build      # Build for production
npm run start      # Start production server
```

### Event Management
- **Add events**: Edit `src/app/components/Events Gallery/eventsData.js`
- **Add images**: Place in `public/images/` directory
- **Test timing**: Change `endTime` to past time, event disappears automatically

## File Structure
```
src/app/components/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Events Gallery/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ EventsGallery.js           # Main component with timing logic
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ EventsGallery.module.scss  # Responsive styling
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ eventsData.js              # Event data and configuration
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Static Work Gallery/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ StaticWorkGallery.js        # Pottery showcase component
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ StaticWorkGallery.module.scss # Grid layout and animations
```

## Dependencies
- **date-fns**: Core date manipulation
- **date-fns-tz**: Timezone conversion for event timing
- **lucide-react**: Icon components (Instagram icon)
- **Next.js**: React framework with Image optimization

## Key Implementation Notes

### Event Timing System
- Events use 24-hour format (`"17:00"` = 5:00 PM)
- All times are in `America/New_York` timezone
- Grace period: Events remain visible until 1 minute after end time
- Comparison uses UTC for accuracy across timezones

### Image Handling
- Event flyers: Use full Next.js image paths (`"/images/filename.jpg"`)
- All images stored in `public/images/` directory
- Automatic optimization via Next.js Image component

### Navigation Logic
- Slide buttons appear only when content overflows container
- Smooth scrolling with 320px increment
- State management tracks left/right scroll capabilities
- Responsive button sizing for mobile devices

## Future Enhancements
- Event filtering by location or type
- Calendar integration
- Email notifications for upcoming events
- Admin panel for event management
- Analytics tracking for event engagement
